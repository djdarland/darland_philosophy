Differences going from life to prolog.
replace load(---)? with [---].
On quieries replace ? with .
Replcace cond with ifthenelse.
write only takes 1 argument.

8/24/2019 Now just using WildLIFE.
1st advantage I notice is predicates don't have fixed arity.
In prolog, you can have predicates with sane mame & differnt arity.
But they are still different predicates.
This is not true of WildLIFE - they are same predicate with different arity.

This should be helpful with, e.g. beliefs which can have variable # of args.

Try to make predicates all lower_case.
Variables Words start with Upper_Case.

Advantage of WildLIFE - can format Rules & Facts so much more readable.

I am having some trouble with predicates with varying number of arguments.
(It's just complicated & tricky.)

Anyway I have decided on the following.
Create 2 sets to repesent my ideas.
1. using variable # of arguments (up to 2) - but not processed as lists.
2. using variable # of arguments - but processed as lists.


Also
Predicates used with either will have no special suffix.
Predicates for (1) will have "_A" suffix.
Predicates for (2) will have "_L" suffix.

I plan to implement 1 first (with up to 2 arguments - besides relation).
It will help with planning - It is conceptually simpler.

The 2nd I will do later - it is more compact & eligant.
It will be able to handle any number of arguments.
