%% Common Prolog & Life predicates
%% to simulate Dennis J. Darlands philosophy. 
%% Started Writing 1/4/2017 
%% This is a total rewrite of what I started
%% about 10 years ago.
%% 
%% December Started adapting to Alfred North Whitehead's
%% Metaphysics
%%

%% propositional attitudes are represented by conceptual
%% feelings with subjective aims such as belief

%%    There is one primitive sort of belief - in ideas

%%    conceptual_feeling_in_ideas(Subject, believes, Time,
%%		      [Relation_Idea,
%%		      A_Idea,
%%		      B_Idea,
%%		      C_Idea, ... ])

%% The Subject at Time has a belief relation
%% between the Relation_Idea and
%% The following Ideas.

%% There are 7 relations of both belief and disbelief.
%% Those of understanding are defined in terms
%% of rrrr and ssss
%% Those of belief require also a
%% conceptual_feeling_in_ideas of belief.

%% The 7 cases are:

%% 1 words
%% 2 ideas
%% 3 objects

%% 4 words_ideas
%% 5 words_objects
%% 6 ideas_objects

%% 7 words_ideas_objects


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% These correspond to understanding.
%% Except they involve belief
