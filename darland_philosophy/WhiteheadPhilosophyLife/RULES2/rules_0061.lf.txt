%% Common Prolog & Life predicates to simulate Dennis J. Darlands philosophy. 
%% Started Writing 1/4/2017 
%% This is a total rewrite of what I started about 10 years ago.

%% This will be a representation of atomic and molecular facts.
%% Only qqqq, qqqq4, qqqq5 and qqqq6 will be uses.
%% Theoretically they can all be considered to represent
%% the same (and only) predicate Q in my philosophy.
%% qqqq4 is for positive atomic facts.
%% qqqq5 is for negative atomic facts.
%% qqqq6 is for positive molecular (including atomic) facts.
%% nand indicates "not and"
%% existential quantification is achieved by using variables.
%% universal quantification can be achieved with "not exists not"

%% I need to determine when to use negation by failure "\+" vs qqqq5.
%% This is a polish notation using nand.


qqqq6([nand, Prop_1, Prop_2]) :-
	qqqq5(Prop_1).

qqqq6([nand, Prop_1, Prop_2]) :-
	qqqq5(Prop_2).
	
qqqq6([nand, [nand, Prop_1, Prop_2], Prop_3]) :-
	\+ qqqq6([nand, Prop_1, Prop_2]).
	
qqqq6([nand, [nand, Prop_1, Prop_2], Prop_3]) :-
	qqqq5([Prop_2]).

qqqq6([nand, [Prop_1], [nand, Prop_2, Prop_3]]) :-
	qqqq5([Prop_1]).
	
qqqq6([nand, [nand, Prop_1, Prop_2], Prop_3]) :-
	\+ qqqq6([nand, Prop_2, Prop_3]).
