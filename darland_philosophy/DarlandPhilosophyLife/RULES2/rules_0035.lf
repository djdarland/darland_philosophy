%% There are 7 relations of both understanding.
%% Those of understanding are defined in terms of rrrr and ssss

%% The 7 cases are:

%% 1 words
%% 2 ideas
%% 3 objects

%% 4 words_ideas
%% 5 words_objects
%% 6 ideas_objects

%% 7 words_ideas_objects

%% These are intended to make testing easier.
%% They are incomplete.
