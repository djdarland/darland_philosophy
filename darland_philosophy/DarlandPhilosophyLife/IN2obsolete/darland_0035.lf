trace_input(true)?

%% This file uses queries for multiple testing of universals.

%% Only understanding so far. Plan to do more.

%% This is an example with a mini universe for queries of high complexity.

%% I use an example from Quine's Word & Object. (pp.144-151).

%% The Story of Cicero and Catiline is given
%% in _Caesar and Christ_, by Will Durant, pp. 140-147.

%% "Tully" is not in the index of that work (or "De Senectute").

%% Wikipedia gives the full name as "Marcus Tullius Cicero"
%% and notes "The name is infrequently anglicized as Tully."
%% It also does not mention "De Senectute".

%% "De Senectute" is in Wikipedia under "Writings of Cicero"

%% Tom believes that Cicero denounced Catiline.
%% Tom does not know Cicero = Tully.

%% In my philosophy, for Tom at that time,
%% "Cicero" R Toms_idea_of_Cicero
%% and
%% Toms_idea of_Cicero S Cicero
%%
%%
%% but not 
%% "Cicero" R Toms_idea_of_Tully
%% 
%%
%% In my program the relation R is represented by the predicate
%% rrrr(Subject, Time, Type, Word, Idea)
%% In my program the relation S is represented by the predicate
%% ssss(Subject, Time, Type, Idea, Object)

%% R | S is represented by rrss

write_time(Ignore)?

%% I indicate for each query whether the immediate response should be
%% TRUE = Yes or FALSE = No

%% There may be subsequient No responses - as I may have asked for additional answers with semicolons.

%% There are 7 relations of both understanding and belief.
%% Those of understanding are defined in terms of rrrr and ssss
%% Those of belief require also a belief_in_ideas relation.

%% The 7 cases are:

%% words
%% ideas
%% objects

%% words_ideas
%% words_objects
%% ideas_objects

%% words_ideas_objects
