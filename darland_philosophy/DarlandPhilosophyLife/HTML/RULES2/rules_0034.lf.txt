%% I take a belief as opaque if the Subject believes and
%% disbelieves the same arguments in a belief.

%% truly_opaque is belief in exact contraries - this never occurrs!

%% It turns out this only occurs in the pseudo_opaque_believes_objects case
%% This is not an ontological problem, because although it is pseudo_opaque,
%% it is defined in terms of universals none of which are opaque.
%% belief and disbelief are not really contraries.
