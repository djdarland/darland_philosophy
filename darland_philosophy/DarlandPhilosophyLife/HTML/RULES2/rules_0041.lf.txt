%%    There is one sort of belief used for truth functions
%%    I had been puzzling how to do truth functions.
%%    Now I have realized. I need NAND!

%%		      A_Idea1,

%%		      C_Idea2, ... ]
%%                    ).

%% The Subject at Time has a NAND belief relation between the two lists
%% 

%% There are 7 relations of believes_nand.
%% Those of understanding are defined in terms of rrrr and ssss
%% Those of belief require also a belief_nand_in_ideas relation.

%% The 7 cases are:

%% 1 words
%% 2 ideas
%% 3 objects

%% 4 words_ideas
%% 5 words_objects
%% 6 ideas_objects

%% 7 words_ideas_objects


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% These correspond to understanding.
%% Except they involve belief as is indeicated by belief_in_ideas.
