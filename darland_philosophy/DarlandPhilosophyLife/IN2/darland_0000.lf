%% Tom believes that Cicero denounced Catiline.
%% Tom does not know Cicero = Tully.

%% In my philosophy, for Tom at that time,
%% "Cicero" R Toms_idea_of_Cicero
%% and
%% Toms_idea of_Cicero S Cicero
%%

%% but not 
%% "Cicero" R Toms_idea_of_Tully

%% In my program the relation R is represented by the predicate

%% In my program the relation S is represented by the predicate
%% ssss(Subject, Time, Type, Idea, Object)
%% R | S is represented by rrss
