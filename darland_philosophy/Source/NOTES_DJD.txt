Differences going from life to prolog.
replace load(---)? with [---].
On quieries replace ? with .
Replcace cond with ifthenelse.
write only takes 1 argument.

8/24/2019 Now just using WildLIFE.
1st advantage I notice is predicates don't have fixed arity.
In prolog, you can have predicates with sane mame & differnt arity.
But they are still different predicates.
This is not true of WildLIFE - they are same predicate with different arity.

This should be helpful with, e.g. beliefs which can have variable # of args.

Try to make predicates all lower_case.
Variables Words start with Upper_Case.

Advantage of WildLIFE - can format Rules & Facts so much more readable.
