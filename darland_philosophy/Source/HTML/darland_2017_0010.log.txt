WildLife permits one more semi-colon after a query. I am debugging mainly in WildLife. WildLife s trace_input does not show comments - that is the reason for the remark predicate!').
remark(1004, 'Lines starting with %%LIFE = are passed through to Wildlife with the prefix removed - the whole line is a blank line in SwiProlog. Vica Versa for SwiProlog & %%PROLOG =. These are only processed the the .bs query files - they are translated into prolog & life versions.').

remark(1007, 'In debugging I have been confused about what the values of Types should be. I have decided to try the following (1/20/2017) after some thought. The lowest level of internal symbols for objects will be 0. The lowest level of internal symbols of relations of objects will be 1. All external symbols (both objects and relations) will be type 2 higher than the internal object it is a symbol of. Objects (internal or extenal) are even numbers. Relations odd numbers.').
remark(1008, 'The amount of Prolog or WildLife I use is small and can be understood easily by anyone with some knowledge of symbolic logic. Other than preprocessing the query file, there are special rules files for prolog & life, but almost all rules are in a common file. All facts are in one file. The idential files are linked with the linux `ln` command (they have different suffixes & are in different directories. BTW: For this reason when extracting from the archive one must use `tar -xhzvf darland_philosophy-mm.nn.tar.gz. The `h` preserves the links').
remark(1009, 'The symbol `:-` corresponds to `if`.').
remark(1010, 'Facts are expressed predicate(atom1, atom2).').
remark(1011, 'A rule might be `grandfather(A, C) :- father(A, B), father(B, C)`. Where father(X, Y) means X is the father of Y, and grandfather(X, Y) means X is the grandfather of Y. Variables are capitalized.').
remark(1012, 'If we had the facts `father(john, richard)` and `father(richard, dennis)` and the rule `grandfather(A, C) :- father(A, B), father(B, C)` then in prolog you could ask `grandfather(john, dennis)` and you would get an affimative answer.You could also ask `grandfather(X, Y)` and you would get all answers for cases wher there were the correct facts. You would need, however to enter a `;` after each one in order to get the next.').
remark(1013, 'The `, ` thus stands for `and` as well as separating arguments or parameters. `or` is implemented by having more than one rule.').
remark(1014, 'Thus `parent(X, Y).` could be defined by two rules: `parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).` and `parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y).`').
remark(1015, 'All facts or rules for a given predicate must be grouped together.').

remark(2002, 'A person (Subject) understands any propositon resulting from symbols he has.').
remark(3001, 'Test Set 3 - about belief.').
remark(3002, 'A person can have contradictory beliefs. This can because he does not know of all facts. Thus for `believes` so defined - it fails of substituitivity of identity. It is not referentially transparent - it is referentially opaque. But this `believes` is defined in terms which themselves are referentially transparent. There is no need to flee intension. We must analyze it when needed. There is no logical problem when `believes` is analyzed. I use one kind of belief in my `database` of facts - `belives_internal`. I define 5 more kinds of belief.(`believes_external_internal_object`, `believes_external_object`, `believes_external_internal`, `believes_internal_object`, and `believes_object`. All are reverentially transparent except `believes_object` - it is reverentially opaque.').
remark(3003, 'Tom believes both `Cicero denounced Cataline.` and `Cicero did not denounced Cataline.` He has two different internal symbols for Cicero (`cicero` and `tully` - but both refer to the same object - there is only one object! And (also) in Prolog or Life two atoms cannot be equal.').
remark(3004, 'In SwiProlog I use `is` for the arithmetic with types. It requires `Type` be instantiated. So multiple queries are needed. With WildLife I could have placed, e.g. `Type + 1` where I used `Type_p1`, and not needed the predicate `type_p1` at all.').
remark(3005, '`believes_internal` is a (here primative) psychological relation between internal symbols. Usually these internal symbols relate to external objects (not always). The relation to the objects is usually learned from interaction with other people. However this is mostly coordinated via the external objects and external symbols. The internal symbols may vary from person to person. I thought about calling the internal symbols `neural centers` - but that is stretching my knowledge. They are referentially transparent - even though `cicero = tully`, `cicero_int != tully_int`.').
remark(3006, '`believes_object` is a (defined) relation between a person and (usually) external objects medeated by symbolic relations. It is referentially opaque. I do not regard that as a problem as the relations it is defined in terms of are referentially transparent.').
remark(3007, 'Beliefs that go all the way to the objects can be opaque. Because we can never have complete knowledge - or, at least, if we do, then opacity never occurs.').
remark(3008, 'Beliefs involving symbols (external or internal) can never be opaque as the symbols themselves are different - whether or not they stand for the same object. Only `believes_object` does not involve symbols. (Althogh symbols are used in its definition, they `cancel out`.').
remark(3009, 'There is a Logical_Form for belief - it is either `pos_pos`, `pos_neg`, `neg_pos` or `neg_neg`. The first neg indicates not believing the second would indicate believing not. For simple beliefs `pos` & `neg` would have been sufficient. They would indicate belief or disbelief. However for those I use `pos_pos` and `pos_neg`. This simplifies things. A logical form of `neg_pos` indicates the person has no belief that something is true. (They might either believe it false or have no belief regarding it. Similarly for `neg_neg`.').

That, of course, is especially likely in very abstract studies such as philosophical logic, because the subject-matter that you are supposed to be thinking of is so exceedingly difficult and elusive that any person who has ever tried to think about it knows you do not think about it except perhaps once in six months for half a minute. The rest of the time you think abut the symbols, because they are tangible, but the thing you are supposed to be thinking about is fearfully difficult and one does not often manage to think about it.

That is, if we believe (say) that A is B, we shall have the ideas of A and of B, and these ideas will be related in a certain manner; but we shall not have a sinle complex idea which can be described as the idea of `A is B`. A belief will then differ from an idea or presentation by the fact that it will consist of several interrelated ideas.

In the event of the objects standing in he corresponding relation, we shall say that the belief is true, or that it is belief in a fact. In the event of the objects not standing in the corresponding relation, there will be no objective complex corresponding to the belief, and the belief is belief in nothing, though it is not `thinking of nothing`, because it is thinking of the objects of the ideas which constitute the belief.

That, of course, is especially likely in very abstract studies such as philosophical logic, because the subject-matter that you are supposed to be thinking of is so exceedingly difficult and elusive that any person who has ever tried to think about it knows you do not think about it except perhaps once in six months for half a minute. The rest of the time you think abut the symbols, because they are tangible, but the thing you are supposed to be thinking about is fearfully difficult and one does not often manage to think about it.
