I'm resuming work on my philosophy programming.
I previously was using both SwiProlog & WildLIFE.
I have done more work on WildLIFE & believe it more solid.
Using just it allows more flexibility in using its features.

It may be obtained at:
https://github.com/djdarland/WildLIFE

I have trimmed down what I had called darland_philosophy-01.24
To include only the WildLIFE portion.
I plan major changes - so will not testing it much.
I wanted it as a starting point, however.
