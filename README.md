I am now working on expressing my ideas in terms
of Alfred North Whitehead's Process and Reality.

NOTES:
You will WildLIFE and Unicon.
See https://github.com/djdarland/WildLIFE

and

http://unicon.org

I got an error using the ppa, but unicon seemed to
work anyway.

then you need to compile qqqq_pre.icn

unicon qqqq_pre.icn

also create directories within DarlandPhilosophyLife:
LFTMP2
REFDIFF2
ERRDIFF2


I restarted my resumtion of my work. I have had several new ideas.
Mainly, I have one main predicate - qqqq (in my writing Q).
My writing is mostly at:
https://eclectic-philosopher.com/e_pluribus_unum/
It is not entirely consistent as my ideas have been evolving.
The maim command I use is now ./eee in the Source directory.
(It was ./ee before I restarted.)
./eee allows (rather will eventually allow) all the program to be demonstrated.
I also plan to eventually make some sort of video demos.
Right now, I am mainly using github to manage my source code.
Even eventually, it will probably be easier to get code from a .tar.gz backup.

I'm resuming work on my philosophy programming.
I previously was using both SwiProlog & WildLIFE.
I have done more work on WildLIFE & believe it more solid.
Using just it allows more flexibility in using its features.

It may be obtained at:
https://github.com/djdarland/WildLIFE

I have trimmed down what I had called darland_philosophy-01.24
To include only the WildLIFE portion.
I plan major changes - so will not testing it much. (Initially).
I wanted it as a starting point, however.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am having some trouble with predicates with varying number of arguments.
(It's just complicated & tricky.) - NOW Solved

Anyway I have decided on the following.
Create 2 sets to repesent my ideas.
1. using variable # of arguments (up to 2) - but not processed as lists.
2. using variable # of arguments - but processed as lists.


Also
Predicates used with either will have no special suffix.
Predicates for (1) will have "_A" suffix.
Predicates for (2) will have "_L" suffix.

I plan to implement 1 first (with up to 2 arguments - besides relation).
It will help with planning - It is conceptually simpler.

The 2nd I will do later - it is more compact & eligant.
It will be able to handle any number of arguments.

All above done.

I've worked out Quine's case from pp. 145-146 of Word & Object.
And more.

Everything is still very early on.
