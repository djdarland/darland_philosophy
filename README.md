The main work is accessed with ./eee
It is largely (but not completely) finished.
Currently I am using option 120 to check results and approve
references to test suite.

Some (using Maple) is accessed with ./mmm

Future work is intended in:

./lll (Gregory Landini's interpretation of Bertrand Russell.)

and

./www (more on Alfred North Whitehead.)


NOTES:
You will need WildLIFE and Unicon.
See https://github.com/djdarland/WildLIFE

and

http://unicon.org

I got an error using the ppa, but unicon seemed to
work anyway.

then you need to compile qqqq_pre.icn

unicon qqqq_pre.icn

I restarted my resumtion of my work. I have had several new ideas.
Mainly, I have one main predicate - qqqq (in my writing Q).
My writing is mostly at:
https://eclectic-philosopher.com/e_pluribus_unum/
It is not entirely consistent as my ideas have been evolving.
The maim command I use is now ./eee in the Source directory.
(It was ./ee before I restarted.)
./eee allows (rather will eventually allow) all the program to be demonstrated.
I also plan to eventually make some sort of video demos.
Right now, I am mainly using github to manage my source code.
You can get .zip file from github.

It may be obtained at:
https://github.com/djdarland/WildLIFE

I have trimmed down what I had called darland_philosophy-01.24
To include only the WildLIFE portion.
I plan major changes - so will not testing it much. (Initially).
I wanted it as a starting point, however.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am having some trouble with predicates with varying number of arguments.
(It's just complicated & tricky.) - NOW Solved


I am using variable # of arguments - but processed as lists.

I've worked out Quine's case from pp. 145-146 of Word & Object.
And more.
