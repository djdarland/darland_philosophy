I'm resuming work on my philosophy programming.
I previously was using both SwiProlog & WildLIFE.
I have done more work on WildLIFE & believe it more solid.
Using just it allows more flexibility in using its features.

It may be obtained at:
https://github.com/djdarland/WildLIFE

I have trimmed down what I had called darland_philosophy-01.24
To include only the WildLIFE portion.
I plan major changes - so will not testing it much. (Initially).
I wanted it as a starting point, however.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

I am having some trouble with predicates with varying number of arguments.
(It's just complicated & tricky.) - NOW Solved

Anyway I have decided on the following.
Create 2 sets to repesent my ideas.
1. using variable # of arguments (up to 2) - but not processed as lists.
2. using variable # of arguments - but processed as lists.


Also
Predicates used with either will have no special suffix.
Predicates for (1) will have "_A" suffix.
Predicates for (2) will have "_L" suffix.

I plan to implement 1 first (with up to 2 arguments - besides relation).
It will help with planning - It is conceptually simpler.

The 2nd I will do later - it is more compact & eligant.
It will be able to handle any number of arguments.

All above done.

I've worked out Quine's case from pp. 145-146 of Word & Object.
And more.

Everything is still very early on.
